Optometry Ensenmble

Hi, thank you for downloading my program. 
Hi, thank you for downloading my program. This algorithm was made for my Intelligent Systems class. The objective of it, its to make a diagnostic for 
Opticas Mega View clients. The goal is to identify if the user has either myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, or any combination. Once they have their diagnostic, 
they can get an approx. of how much are they going to have to spend. Maybe by this point you will be able to test the part of the algorithm where we apply kmeans, 
so you can get the appropriate lens treatment. 

In order to test it out, follow the next steps:
1- Download the document Optometry Ensemble.pptx (just to have a better context of the ametropias the algorith can predict.
2- Download the file ProyectoFinal.ipynb or .py

Once you have download it. You have to run it and the program will ask you some questions, follow the instructions and answer correctly. If any error happend try again. 
The algorithm will pop out the estimated class and the ametropia you may have. THIS IS JUST A DIAGNOST, PLEASE VISIT YOUR TRUSTY OPTOMETRIST.
